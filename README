 svn-multi (was svnkw)
 version 1.5, Feb 28th, 2009
--------------------------------------------------------------

This package lets you typeset keywords of the version
control system Subversion inside your LaTeX files anywhere
you like. Unlike the very similar package 'svn' the usage of
multiple files for one LaTeX document is well supported.

The Current Maintainer of this work is Martin Scharrer.

This work consists of the files svn-multi.dtx and svn-multi.ins
and the derived files svn-multi.sty and svnkw.sty.


Tiny example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put the following Subversion keyword in all your LaTeX files of
your document:

\svnid{$Id$}

Subversion will expand it (set property svn:keyword to 'Id') and
then you can typeset the SVN information using
    \svnauthor, \svnrev, \svndate, \svnhour, ...
which will hold the information of the latest comitted file
anywhere in your multi-file LaTeX document.

Also per-file macros exist:
    \svnfileauthor, \svnfilerev, ...
which hold the keyword values of the current file.


INSTALL:
~~~~~~~~
From the .dtx file (if you don't get the .sty files directly):
==================
Unpack the zip file and run 'make'.
You also can do it manually:
  [pdf]latex svn-multi.ins  # for the style file
  [pdf]latex svn-multi.dtx  # for the documentation
  [pdf]latex example-main.tex   # for the example

Place the two .sty files
  svn-multi.sty         # Package
  svnkw.sty         # Wrapper for backward compatibility
into your TEXMF tree, e.g. in
  $TEXMF/tex/latex/svn-multi
